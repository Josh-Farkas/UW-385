Game Design Principles One Pager

Reward Calculated Risk
An important game design principle is rewarding calculated risk. This means that players should be able to take risks and in turn get better rewards because of it, leading to more engaging gameplay where players have to balance how much risk they want to take on for future gain. A game with a good example of this is Risk of Rain 2. In it, stages can spawn "Shrines of the Mountain" which can be triggered to make the boss at the end of the level harder, but drop more items. The pros of the principle is that it lets players make the game as difficult as they want it to be, and to give players a sense of accomplishment for completing a hard task. The cons are that some players might not learn how to manage the risk well, and thus make the game far too difficult for themselves which may make them think the game is too challenging. On the contrary they might never take risks, which could make them never get the better rewards, which also would make the game harder. In my game, during combat coins can spawn on your pieces, which let you get more money the longer the fight goes on. If you take the risk of drawing out the fight to get more coins you might lose, but if you succeed you'll be much richer.

Balance the Game
Balancing the game means making sure that all options the player can take have at least some viability. If there is always one option that is superior to all others, players will ignore the other options and only choose that. This is common in online shooter games, such as Overwatch and Marvel rivals, where there are a set of meta characters that have far higher pick rate than others simply because they’re stronger. This often comes at the detriment of player enjoyment, for example the double shield meta in Overwatch was complained about because it led to boring gameplay where you just sat behind shields, but since it was the strongest option available everyone played it. A great quote about this is “Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.” The cons of balancing a game are that sometimes if everything feels the same you never get great moments where you get a very powerful item. In my game, I’ll try to make sure most effects are balanced, but I might not balance everything so that if you get lucky something can feel truly powerful.

Keep Players Immersed
To keep players immersed, keep things inside your game world when possible. For example, don’t have tons of popups that show up, which takes your player out of the game. The phrase “Keep it on the grid” works well for this. When possible, put something like an upgrade in the actual world rather than in a menu, since it leads to more interactions and immersion for the player. Games like Hollow Knight do this well, where getting a nail upgrade or new skill come from finding an NPC and having them teach you, rather than some arbitrary skill tree or menu. The map is the same, where you have to find a mapmaker and buy a quill and compass, rather than just having it by default without explanation. By keeping immersion players can have more fun and are likely to be more invested in your game. The cons of this is that it may be more confusing for some if they can’t find an option or thing that’s normally in the menu, such as a volume slider or controls, and sometimes you really do need confirmation before an important decision. When possible I’ll try to put upgrades and things in the world, though since my game isn’t really a story game or exploration based it’s going to be harder to get players immersed.
