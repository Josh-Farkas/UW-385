**Pitch**
Do you enjoy Tetris, do you enjoy roguelikes, what about deckbuilders like Peglin and Slay the Spire? If you do, then my game is the game for you.
It combines elements of all three to form a fast paced and complex game where you apply effects to your Tetris pieces in order to defeat enemies and progress through the levels.
Each run will be entirely different, as between fights you can buy more pieces and effects to use in future combats.


**Game Synopsis**
As you travel through the dungeon, you’ll find and defeat enemies that get progressively more difficult by using your deck of Tetris pieces. 
Collect coins during gameplay to buy more effects to add to your pieces in the shop, and create a powerful deck with synergies to defeat the enemies! 
Watch out, as the enemies can place attacks on the board that you’ll have to avoid placing pieces on. 
If you run out of health, you lose and have to start from the beginning!

**Objective**
The objective of the game is to defeat all the enemies and reach the final boss. Once you defeat him you win.


**Mechanics**
Players will play Tetris with their custom pieces. 
Each cell on a piece can have a different effect on it, such as a sword that does 2 damage when it’s cleared, or a shield that gives block. 
During combat coins will spawn on their pieces, and clearing them will collect them. 
After each combat, the player will enter the shop and be able to buy new effects to add to their pieces, or new pieces entirely.

**Mockup**
Images can be found of a mockup of the shop and the game screen. Right now I'm just using the tileset from the pieces, but I'll want to make them look much nicer with custom UI
