My inspiration for my game is Roguelites, specifically deckbuilders like Balatro, Slay the Spire, Peglin, Backpack Hero, and many more that I've played. The game Peglin has you playing peggle to fight monsters, with the deckbuilding aspect being the orbs you use having different effects. The most well known and in my opinion best deckbuilder is Slay the Spire which popularized and set the standard for the genre, I have lots of concepts that I like from it, especially how the cards in the game can synergize in many different ways.
